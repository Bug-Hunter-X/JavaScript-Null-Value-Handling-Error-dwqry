# JavaScript Null Value Handling Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to handling null values and its solution.  The `bug.js` file contains code that doesn't properly handle null inputs, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors. The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version that explicitly checks for null values before proceeding. 

This is a simple example, but the principle of explicit null checking applies to more complex situations where null values could cause unforeseen issues, including type errors and unexpected program termination.
